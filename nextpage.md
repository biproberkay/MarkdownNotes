# Dont Repeat Yourself
To make updates easier (not to mention, keeping things DRY), you can create a list of links at the bottom of the file, and reference them in multiple places by name. The list won't render on the page, so visitors won't even know it's there, and it makes one convenient place to do updates.

If you take [issue][issues] with any [issues][issues]
I [issued][issues], grab a tissue.

If you find a bug, please report an [issue][issues], or better yet,
fix it and submit a [pull request][pulls].
